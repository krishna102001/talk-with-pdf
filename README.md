# Talk with PDF

**Talk with PDF** is a web application that allows users to ask questions and get instant answers from the contents of large PDF files without the need to scroll through them. The application leverages powerful AI tools like Langchain, Ollama (with models like gemma3:1b and nomic-embed-text), Qdrant for vector databases, Redis for queue management, and integrates Next.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.
